TDMF Text File Location Version 1.0 by Amel/Amko

(Used abbrevations: e.g. : example given; UI: User Interface)

This file contains almost all TDMF text file locations (.dat files + their respective archive)
and is meant to structurize the tranlsating progress of TDMF. Each dat file has a short 
description what text it stores. Every .dat file is placed under its archive in this document.

To efficiently edit the text from .dat files, the tdmfscripteditor is recommended (download link
on the Denpa Men Discord Server in pinned message in the channel #the-hacker-hole)


Note: Some of the descriptions may not be 100% correct but aim to be pretty accurate, also
the text file location for denpa name templates is not known yet, it's not certain whether
these names are even in one of the archives/.dat files (maybe they are in the ExeFS/Code).
I can't guarantee that altering text in any ofthe mentioned locations will really change text
in TDMF (some definitely work though!).

SECTION II: Dungeon/Stage Text Files NOT 100% CORRECT (Check file structure of stage archives for correct sorting)

Note: This section doesn't list all stage archives, only categorizes and confirms which .dat files
really are text files (there will probably be an addition text file documenting the stage text
location respectively in the future)

USEFUL HINT: 	Every stage file contains an arc-file (use EveryFileExplorer to open) with the stage symbol in a zip-folder, this
		way an unambigous identification of stages is possible (useful for event stages in particular)

General structure of stage archives:
Those archives contain a lot of .dat files, most of them are not text files though. 
It seems to be that for each location a stage has, there is a text file 
(e.g. a dungeon + village + hidden cave => 3 text files for that archive).

	- Archives: ??? - ???: Event stage archives
	 	- 35676C00.dat: Whole text for an event stage 
		(if there are several places on that stage,there are more text dat files in that archive)
		- 3E6EC400.dat: Contains only the word "None" in Japanese, sometimes also probably error
				exception messages
		
	- Archives: 5EFC0000 - 5F7F0000: Story stage archivees
		- 3E6EC400.dat: Contains only the word "None" in Japanese, sometimes also probably error
				exception messages
		- F7638800.dat: Story stage text for a whole area (e.g. cave, village, tower, ...)
				If a story stage has only one area, this dat file then contains all relevant text for the stage
		- D448D800.dat: Example in archive 5EFD0000 (2nd story stage, has 3 different areas), text 
				for an addition area (in this case: the beginning village)
		There are also more possible text files in a stage archive if there are several areas in the stage itself!
		(Browsing through the archives required to find those)
	
	- Archives: 5F330000 - 599BE0000: Extra stage archives
	Archives are identical to story archives but contain usually only one (relevant) text file (besides 3E6EC400.dat)
	as Extra stages usually only have one area (probably even all of them)
		=> F7638800.dat

	- Archives: AF2A0000 - AFAE0000: Stages added after ver. 1.12.0 (stages 21 - 30 and extra stages probably)
	Identical to the story stage archives


SECTION III: Special text
		 
This section right now only covers one archive but is seperated by the others as that archive is between the stage
archives but actually contains very important text files

	- Archive: 5EFB0000 ("Main Island text")
		- 35676C00.dat: Event based island dialogue (e.g. Kaneko coming back from vacation after clearing some
		  extra stages, results of a team competition event announced on the island, also probably unlocking 
		  recycling shop)
	
		- B6B51000.dat: All story relevant text between the Hero and Kaneko (as well as other appearing 
		  characters) on the Main Island

I hope this text file is useful for a team translation approach of TDM FREE, though I cannot guarantee that all of these
locations are correctly mentioned. I've analyzed the text files quite intensively so the text file locations should be 
accurate.
If there are any questions, you can ask me (Amel/Amko) on Discord (e.g. on the denpa men Discord server in #the-hacker-hole).
I plan to analyze (and document) the text script as well as the stage text archive locations so that a translation of TDMF
will be systematically feasible in the future.

Thanks to NerduMiner for providing the tools to make this documentation and the translation for TDM FREE possible!
