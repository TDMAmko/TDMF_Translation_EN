These arc files contain text for some buttons/small text sections.
You need to extract the specific bcflyt files via Kurimu2
Here, tdmfscripteditor cannot be used!
tdmextractor is still used to repack/extract archives

Be sure that the arc files are not "read-only" before replacing
edited bcflyt files (by right-clicking and checking "properties" of arc file)

Problems:
-Shopping dialogue text must be stored here
-Sort button for the Denpa Box untranslated, must be here


Hint: 
-Redundancy, some text already translated (and applied in-game)
no need to translate every text if already translated in-game!!!
